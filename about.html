        <h2>ABOUT LG SNAPSHOTS</h2>
        <p>Hello. My name is Lee. In 2013, whilst I was still in secondary school, I took a Higher class in Photography. I always had a keen interest in taking photos and videos, however when I got to use a Nikon DSLR for the first time, I was obsessed. The DSLR wasn't mines, unfortunately, but it did inspire me to go out and buy a Fujifilm bridge camera with a fantastic zoom, and I spent quite a bit of time with that taking plenty of good photos. Unfortunately I didn't do a great job of keeping those at the time.</p>
        <p>So why did I decide to start LG Snapshots?</p>
        <p>Well, I already have my small pages on Facebook and Instagram, which I started as a way to share some of my adventures and my better photographs. I'll definitely be continuing to add content and posts to those for sure. That being said, given that I am currently studying Computer Science in college with a view to continuing on to university, and also having a keen interest in web development, I thought it would be a cool idea to make a website, which would allow me to make a more detailed and professional portfolio of my photography work.</p>
        <h2>MY PHOTOGRAPHY INTERESTS</h2>
        <p>I like taking photos of a lot of different things, but the three main areas of focus for me are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Wildlife & Nature</b> - The great outdoors. For me, photography is a way to document and look back upon great adventures that I've had. From bugs and squirrels to deer and landscapes, I love taking photos of the outdoors and the natural world.</li>
            <li><b>Travel & City</b> - I like to do a lot of travelling, and so for the same reasons as above, I love taking plenty of photos of the places I visit. This in the past has included city breaks in other countries as well as visits to quaint villages and old towns in Scotland.</li>
            <li><b>Aviation</b> - My great childhood obsession. As a keen "plane geek" (and a microlight pilot) I love seeing and getting photos of all different kinds of planes, helicopters and anything else that flies.</li>
        </ul>
